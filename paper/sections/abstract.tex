% We examine interplay of electricity and hydrogen transmission grids in the high
% resolution (181 nodes) all-energy-sector open-source model of the European
% energy system, PyPSA-Eur-Sec.
% variability of demand and variable renewable supply can be represented, and existing grid bottlenecks are visible.
% applied net-zero emission constraint
% The combination of a need for cross-continental energy transport and low
% acceptance for electricity grid reinforcement makes a hydrogen backbone attractive
