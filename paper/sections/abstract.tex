Electricity transmission expansion has suffered many delays in Europe in recent
decades, despite its importance for integrating renewable electricity into the
energy system. A hydrogen network  which reuses the existing fossil gas network
would not only help supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could also help to
balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and thus avoid
power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed expansion of
electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero \co scenarios for a sector-coupled
European energy system with high shares of renewables and self-sufficient
supply. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, and industry sectors
across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With this high
spatio-temporal resolution, we can capture bottlenecks in transmission and the
variability of demand and renewable supply. Our results show a consistent
benefit of a pan-continental hydrogen backbone that connects high-yield regions
with demand centers, synthetic fuel production and geological storage sites.
Developing a hydrogen network reduces system costs by up to 6\%, with highest
benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised. Between 58\%
and 66\% of this backbone could be built from repurposed gas pipelines. However,
we find that hydrogen networks can only partially substitute for power grid
expansion, and that both can achieve strongest cost savings of 12\% together.
