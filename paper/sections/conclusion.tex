In this work, we have demonstrated the benefit of a hydrogen network in net-zero
\co scenarios for Europe with high shares of renewables. Analysis was performed
using the open sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec featuring high
spatio-temporal coverage of all energy sectors (electricity, buildings,
transport, agriculture and industry across 181 regions and 3-hourly resolution
for a year). With this level of spatial, temporal, technological and sectoral
resolution, it is possible to represent grid bottlenecks as well as the
variability and regional distribution of demand and renewable supply. Thereby,
the system's infrastructure needs regarding generation, storage, transmission
and conversion can be assessed. This includes in particular trade-offs between
electricity grid reinforcement, which has limited public support, and developing
a hydrogen network, for which increasingly unused gas pipelines can be
repurposed.

One of the biggest changes seen in the energy system besides renewables
expansion is the built-out of hydrogen infrastructure. Huge new electrolyzer
capacities enter the system and operate flexibly to aid renewables integration.
Furthermore, underground storage in salt caverns is developed for seasonal
balancing and a new continent-spanning hydrogen pipeline network is built to
connect cheap supply and storage potentials with demand centres. This new
hydrogen backbone is found to be supported by considerable amounts of gas
pipeline retrofitting: between 58\% and 66\% of the network uses repurposed
pipelines.

Our analysis reveals that a hydrogen network can reduce system costs by up to
6\%. Its benefit is shown to be highest when the expansion of the power grid is
restricted. However, hydrogen networks can only partially substitute for grid
expansion. We found that in fact both ways of transporting energy and balancing
renewable generation complement each other and achieve the highest cost savings
of up to 12\% together. At the same time, however, these findings also support
the interpretation that neither electricity nor hydrogen network expansion are
essential for achieving a cost-effective system design if such a cost surcharge
can be accepted for alternative motives.

In conclusion, there appear to be many infrastructure trade-offs regarding how
energy is transported across Europe with limited impacts on total system cost
such that policymakers could choose from a wide range of near-optimal compromise
energy system designs with equally low cost but possibly higher acceptance.

% cross-sectoral approaches are important to reduce CO2 emissions cost-effectively and for flexibility
% If onshore wind expansion is restricted too, costs rise by further 104 billion per year
% all results depend strongly on uncertain assumptions and model simplifications
% - openness and transparency are critical
% Electricity grid reinforcements could reduce system costs by up to 8\%.
