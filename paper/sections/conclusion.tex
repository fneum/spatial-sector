cross-sectoral approaches are important to reduce CO2 emissions cost-effectively and for flexibility

there are many trade-offs between unpopular infrastructure and system cost

through limiting power grid expansion, hydrogen network infrastructure

e.g. limiting power grid expansion costs 40-50 billion per year more

If onshore wind expansion is restricted too, costs rise by further 120 billion per year

but many near-optimal compromise energy systems with equally low cost but higher acceptance

hydrogen networks can partially substitute for power grid expansion, but system costs are
3-5\% higher

can also get away with neither power grid expansion nor hydrogen network

all results depend strongly on assumptions and modelling approach
