In this work, we have examined the benefit of a hydrogen network in net-zero \co
scenarios for Europe with high shares of renewables. Analysis was performed
using the open sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec featuring
spatial (181 regions) as well as temporal (3-hourly time series) coverage of all
energy sectors (electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture and industry).
With this level of spatial, temporal and sectoral resolution, it is possible to
represent grid bottlenecks and demand and renewable supply variability. Thereby,
the system's infrastructure needs can be assessed. This includes trade-offs
between electricity grid reinforcement, which has limited public support, and
developing a hydrogen network, for which increasingly expendable gas pipelines
can be repurposed.

One of the biggest changes seen in the energy system besides renewables
expansion is the built-out of hydrogen infrastructure. Huge new electrolyzer
capacities enter the system and operate flexibly to aid renewables integration.
Furthermore, underground storage in salt caverns is developed for seasonal
balancing and a new continent-spanning hydrogen pipeline network to connect
cheap supply and storage potentials with demand centres. This new hydrogen
backbone is found to be supported by considerable amounts of gas pipeline
retrofitting: between 58\% and 66\% of the network uses repurposed pipelines.

Our analysis reveals that a hydrogen network can reduce system costs by up to
6\%. Its benefit is shown to be highest when the expansion of the power grid is
restricted. However, hydrogen networks can only partially substitute for grid
expansion.  In fact, we found that both ways of transporting energy and balancing
renewable generation complement each other and achieve the highest cost savings
of up to 12\% together. At the same time, however, these findings also support
the interpretation that neither electricity nor hydrogen network expansion are
essential for achieving a cost-effective system design.

In conclusion, there appear to be many infrastructure trade-offs with limited
impacts on total system cost such that policymakers could choose from a wide
range of near-optimal compromise energy systems with equally low cost but
possibly higher acceptance.

% cross-sectoral approaches are important to reduce CO2 emissions cost-effectively and for flexibility
% If onshore wind expansion is restricted too, costs rise by further 104 billion per year
% all results depend strongly on uncertain assumptions and model simplifications
% - openness and transparency are critical
% Electricity grid reinforcements could reduce system costs by up to 8\%.
