In this work, we have investigated the potential role of a hydrogen network in
net-zero \co scenarios for Europe with high shares of renewables. The analysis
was performed using the open sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec
featuring high spatio-temporal coverage of all energy sectors (electricity,
buildings, transport, agriculture and industry across 181 regions and 3-hourly
resolution for a year). With this level of spatial, temporal, technological and
sectoral resolution, it is possible to represent grid bottlenecks as well as the
variability and regional distribution of demand and renewable supply. Thereby,
the system's infrastructure needs regarding generation, storage, transmission
and conversion can be assessed. This includes in particular trade-offs between
electricity grid reinforcement, which has limited public support, and developing
a hydrogen network, for which increasingly unused gas pipelines can be
repurposed.

Besides large-scale renewables expansion, the build-out of hydrogen
infrastructure is one of the biggest changes seen in our scenarios of the future
European energy system. Huge new electrolyser capacities enter the system and
operate flexibly to aid renewables integration. Furthermore, underground storage
in salt caverns is developed for seasonal balancing and a new continent-spanning
hydrogen pipeline network is built to connect cheap supply and storage
potentials with demand centres. This new hydrogen network is found to be
supported by considerable amounts of gas pipeline retrofitting: between
\minretroshare\% and \maxretroshare\% of the network uses repurposed pipelines.

Our analysis reveals that a hydrogen network can reduce energy system costs by
up to \maxhybenefitrel\%. Cost reductions are shown to be highest when the
expansion of the power grid is restricted. However, hydrogen networks can only
partially substitute for grid expansion. We found that in fact both ways of
transporting energy and balancing renewable generation complement each other and
achieve the highest cost savings of up to \gridbenefitrel\% together. At the
same time, these findings also support the interpretation that neither
electricity nor hydrogen network expansion are essential for achieving a
cost-effective system design if such a cost premium can be accepted to achieve
alternative goals.

In conclusion, there appear to be many infrastructure trade-offs regarding how
energy is transported across Europe with limited impacts on total system cost
such that policymakers could choose from a wide range of near-optimal compromise
energy system designs with equally low cost but possibly higher acceptance.
