\section{Techno-Economic Assumptions}
\label{sec:si:costs}

Net-zero expected in 2035-2060, so take 2030 costs to be conservative, and also because of pathway (if want in 2050, much of infrastructure is built 2030-2050). NB: Even though total cost may be high, we're mostly focused on comparative study.
