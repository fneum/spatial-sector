\section{Techno-Economic Assumptions}
\label{sec:si:costs}

For the techno-economic assumptions, we take cost estimates for the year 2030.
Many of those come from a technology database published by the Danish Energy
Agency (DEA) \citeS{}. We take 2030 technology assumptions to be cautious of
future technology developments and because the pathway to carbon-neutrality
implies that much of the infrastructure must be built well in advance of 2050.
