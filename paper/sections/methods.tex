In this section the core characteristics and assumptions of the model
PyPSA-Eur-Sec are presented. More detailed descriptions of specific sectors,
energy carriers, renewable potentials, transmission infrastructure modelling,
and mathematical problem formulation are covered in the supplementary material
under \crefrange{sec:si:model-overview}{sec:si:math}.

The European sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec uses linear
optimisation to minimise total annual operational and investment costs subject
to technical and physical constraints, assuming perfect competition and perfect
foresight over one year of 3-hourly operation (see \cref{sec:si:math} for
mathematical formulation). In this study, we used the historical year 2013 for
weather-dependent inputs. Apart from existing electricity transmission and
hydroelectric facilities, no other existing assets are assumed (so-called
`greenfield optimisation' or `overnight scenario'), so that the model represents
an ideal steady state and disregards pathway dependencies.  Cost assumptions are
taken, where possible, from predictions for the year 2030 by the Danish Energy
Agency \cite{dea2019} (see \cref{sec:si:costs}). The model is implemented in the
free software framework Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA)
\cite{brownPyPSAPython2018}.

PyPSA-Eur-Sec builds upon the model from \cite{brownSynergiesSector2018}, which
covered electricity, heating in buildings and ground transport in Europe with
one node per country. PyPSA-Eur-Sec adds biomass on the supply side, industry,
aviation and shipping on the demand side, and higher spatial resolution to
suitably assess infrastructure requirements. Unavoidable process emissions, as
well as the need for feedstocks for the chemicals industry and dense hydrocarbon
fuels for aviation, necessitate careful management of the carbon cycle,
including carbon capture from industry, biomass combustion and directly from the
air.

Energy sector coupling, storage and conversion is modelled to connect
electricity, heating (individual buildings, district heating and industry),
transport and gas (methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide) in the different
sectors (buildings, transport and industry). \cref{fig:multisector} gives an
overview of the supply, transmission, storage and demand sectors implemented in
the European sector-coupled model PyPSA-Eur-Sec. Generator capacities (for
onshore wind, offshore wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), biomass and natural gas),
storage capacities (for batteries, hydrogen, methane, liquid hydrocarbons,
carbon dioxide and hot water tanks), heating capacities (for heat pumps,
resistive heaters, gas boilers, combined heat and power (CHP) plants and solar
thermal collector units), carbon capture (from industry, CHP plants and directly
from the air), energy converters (electrolyzers, methanation, Fischer-Tropsch),
energy storage (batteries, hydrogen storage in caverns and steel tanks,
pumped-hydro and reservoirs), and transmission capacities for electricity and
hydrogen are all subject to optimisation, as well as the operational dispatch of
each unit in each hour. Demand curves for the different sectors, the ratio of
district heating to decentralised heating, the number of electric vehicles,
methane storage and hydroelectricity capacities (for reservoir and run-of-river
generators and pumped hydro storage) are exogenous to the model.

\textbf{supply}

The \textbf{transmission} network for European electricity transport is based on
the open model PyPSA-Eur presented in \cite{horschPyPSAEurOpen2018}. The full
European transmission network is clustered down to 181 representative regions
based on the methodology used in \cite{Hoersch2017,frysztackiStrongEffect2021},
thereby preserving the most important transmission corridors that cause
bottlenecks. The linearised optimal power flow uses a cycle-based formulation
from \cite{horschLinearOptimal2018} that significantly improves computational
performance.

For \textbf{industry}, we change some industrial processes to low-emission ones (e.g.
switching to hydrogen for direct reduction of iron ore \cite{voglAssessmentHydrogen2018}), allow
more recycling of steel and aluminium \cite{circular_economy}, switch fuel
sources for process heat, use synthetic fuels for ammonia and organic chemicals,
and allow carbon capture. It is assumed that no plastic or other non-energy
product is sequestered in landfill, but that all carbon in plastics eventually
makes its way back to the atmosphere, either through combustion or decay; this
approach is stricter than other models \cite{in-depth_2018}.
(separately for sectors including iron and steel, concrete, chemicals)

The \textbf{transport} sector comprises light and heavy road, rail, shipping and
aviation transport. For road and rail, electrification and fuel cell vehicles are
available. For shipping, liquid hydrogen is considered. For aviation, we
consider dense liquid hydrocarbons. Battery electric vehicles for passenger
transport can be enables with demand response as well as vehicle-to-grid
capabilities.

The model can \textbf{convert} between various energy carriers. Electricity can
be converted to heat via heat pumps or resistive heaters; to hydrogen gas, or
further to methane and liquid hydrocarbons; or to work in various demand
devices. Methane can be reformed to hydrogen, and most fuels can be used for
electricity generation in turbines or fuel cells.

Energy and material \textbf{storage} can be optimised including conventional
pumped hydro storage, electrochemical storage like Lithium ion batteries,
storage of gases including methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, storage of
liquid fuels, as well as thermal energy storage in the form of hot water both in
individual buildings and in district heating networks. For hydro storage, we
consider existing capacities. For hydrogen storage, regional potentials for
storage in salt caverns are included.

For \textbf{biomass}, only waste and residues from agriculture and forestry are
permitted, using the most conservative potential estimates from the JRC ENSPRESO
database \cite{jrcbiomass2015}. This results in 347~TWh per year of biogas and
1186~TWh per year of solid biomass residues and waste for the whole of Europe.
Biomass can be used in electricity generation with and without CCS, as well as
to provide low- to medium-temperature process heat in industry.

\textbf{Carbon capture} is needed in the model both to capture and sequester
process emissions with a fossil origin, such as those from calcination of fossil
limestone in the cement industry, as well as to use carbon for the
production of hydrocarbons for dense transport fuels and as a chemical
feedstock, for example for the plastics industry.
