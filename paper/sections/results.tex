\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:sensitivity-h2}, we first compare the total system costs and their
composition between the four main scenarios, which vary in whether or not the
power grid can be expanded beyond today's levels and if a new hydrogen backbone
based on new and retrofitted pipelines can be built. Across all four scenarios,
the total system costs are dominated by investments in generation from wind and
solar and conversion from power to heat (primarily heat pumps) and to hydrogen
and liquid hydrocarbons (for transport fuels and as a feedstock for the
chemicals industry). System costs vary between 764 and 857~bn\euro/a, depending
on available network expansion options.

Overall, we find that system costs are not overly affected by restrictions on
the development of electricity or hydrogen transmission infrastructure. The
realisable cost savings are small compared to total system costs, and systems
without grid expansion present themselves as equally feasible alternatives. The
combined net benefit of hydrogen and electricity grid expansion is 93~bn\euro/a;
a system without either would be around 12\% more expensive. This limited cost
increase can be attributed to the high level of synthetic fuel production for
industry, transport, and backup electricity and heating applications. The option
for a flexible operation of conversion plants, cheap energy storage and low-cost
energy transport as hydrocarbons between regions offer sufficient leeway to
manage electricity and hydrogen transport restrictions effectively (see \nameref{sec:es}).

The total net benefit of power grid expansion is between \euro46-62~billion per
year compared to costs for transmission line reinforcements between
\euro11-14~billion per year. System costs decrease despite the increasing
investments in electricity transmission infrastructure. The benefit is strongest
if no hydrogen network can compensate for the lack of electricity grid capacity
to transport energy over long distances. \cref{sec:si:lv} presents additional
intermediate results about the system cost sensitivity between a doubling of
power grid capacity and no grid expansion. Electricity grid reinforcement
enables renewable resources with better capacity factors to be integrated from
further away, resulting in lower capacity needs for solar and wind. The grid
also allows renewable variations to be smoothed in space and facilitates the
integration of offshore wind, resulting in lower hydrogen demand for balancing
power and heat and less hydrogen infrastructure. A restriction on the level of
power grid expansion leads to more local production from solar photovoltaics and
increased hydrogen production.

The presence of a new hydrogen backbone can reduce system costs by up to 6\%.
The net benefit between \euro31-46~billion per year (4-6\%) largely exceeds the
cost of the hydrogen network, which costs between \euro5-8~billion per year. Its
benefit is strongest when the electricity grid is not expanded. However, even
with high levels of power grid expansion, the hydrogen backbone is still beneficial
infrastructure.

Although grid reinforcements provide slightly higher cost reductions, hydrogen and
electricity transmission infrastructure are strongest together. Approximately
half of the combined benefit of transmission infrastructure can be achieved by
only building a new hydrogen backbone. In contrast, two-thirds of the benefit
can be reached by exclusively reinforcing the electricity transmission system.
Compared to the combined net benefit of 93 bn\euro/a, the individual benefits
sum up to a value that is only 16\% higher ($46+62=108$ bn\euro/a). Thus,
offered cost reductions are mainly additive.

This also means that a hydrogen backbone cannot substitute perfectly for power
grid reinforcements. It can only partially compensate for the lack of grid
expansion, yielding roughly 75\% of the electricity grid's benefit. Instead,
energy transport as electrons and molecules seem to offer complementary
strengths. From a system-level perspective, reductions of total costs achieved
by network expansion are small. A system built exclusively around hydrogen
network expansion is just around 2\% more expensive than an alternative system
that only allows electricity grid expansion. % (4\% without onshore wind)

\section*{Common features across four scenarios of European climate neutrality}
\label{sec:es}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\nameref{sec:es}}

Across all scenarios, we see \SIrange{210}{270}{\giga\watt} offshore wind,
\SIrange{1820}{1950}{\giga\watt} onshore wind, and
\SIrange{2380}{3630}{\giga\watt} solar photovoltaics (\cref{fig:capacities}).
The wide range of solar capacities are due to an increased localisation of
electricity generation when the expansion of transmission infrastructure is
limited. Across all scenarios, the capacities of photovoltaics split roughly
into 10\% rooftop PV and 90\% utility-scale PV. The offshore share of wind
generation capacities varies between 10\% and 13\% and is highest when
transmission networks can be fully expanded.

The spatial distribution of investments per scenario is shown in \cref{fig:tsc}.
For instance, \cref{fig:tsc:w-el-w-h2} shows the least-cost solution with
full electricity and hydrogen network expansion. While solar capacities are
spread relatively evenly around the continent with a stronger presence in
Southern Europe, both onshore and offshore wind are concentrated around the
North Sea and the British Isles. When allowed, new electricity transmission
capacity is built where they help the integration of wind and the transport to
inland demand centres (see \nameref{sec:h2}).

Furthermore, electrolyser capacities for power-to-hydrogen see a massive
scale-up to between \SIrange{1057}{1297}{\giga\watt} depending on the permitted
energy transport infrastructure (\cref{fig:capacities}). The capacities are
lowest when the electricity grid can be expanded. In this case, their locations
correlate strongly with wind capacities (Pearson correlation coefficient
$R^2=0.85$ compared to $R^2=0.37$ for solar capacities, \cref{fig:tsc}). New
hydrogen infrastructure accompanies the build-out of hydrogen production
facilities. A system of hydrogen underground storage and pipelines in Europe
helps to balance generation from renewables in time and space.

In space, a new pipeline network transports hydrogen from preferred production
sites to the rest of Europe, where hydrogen is consumed by industry (for
ammonia, high-value chemicals and steel production), heavy-duty transport, and
fuel cells for power and heat backup. Varying in magnitude per scenario, we see
major net flows of hydrogen from the British Isles and France to the Benelux
Union and Germany, and from the North East of Spain to Southern France. Compared
to net flows in the electricity network, which also balances renewable
generation back and forth as weather systems pass the continent, the hydrogen
network more distinctly targets energy transport over long distances (see also
\nameref{sec:imbalance} and \cref{fig:si:flow-ac,fig:si:flow-h2}). The
favoured network topology strongly depends on the potentials for cheap renewable
electricity. If onshore wind potentials were restricted, e.g. due to limited
social acceptance in Northern Europe, the network infrastructure would be
tailored to deliver larger amounts of solar-based hydrogen from Southern Europe
to Central Europe. We discuss this supplementary sensitivity analysis in
\cref{sec:si:onw,sec:si:onw-compromise}.

The development of a hydrogen backbone is driven by the fact that (i) industry
demand for hydrogen is located in areas with less attractive renewable
potentials, (ii) the best wind and solar potentials are located in the periphery
of Europe, (iii) bottlenecks in the electricity transmission network exist and
give impetus to alternative energy transport options, and (iv) moving produced
hydrogen to locations where the geological conditions allow for cheap
underground storage is more cost-effective than local storage where there are no
salt deposits and only steel tanks are available to the model. Another location
factor for hydrogen network infrastructure is linked to the siting of synthetic
liquid hydrocarbon production. Because we assume that waste heat from these
processes can be recovered in district heating networks, urban areas with
attractive renewable potentials nearby appear to be preferred sites for
synthetic fuels production to which additional hydrogen would need to be
transferred (\cref{fig:si:waste-heat-synfuels}). Because of our assumption that
oil and gas can be moved freely in the model, the spatial distribution of their
demands is not a siting factor that is taken into account. Neither is the
location of carbon dioxide sources.

The flexible operation of electrolysers further supports the system integration
of variable renewables in time. Hydrogen production leverages periods with
exceptionally high wind speeds across Europe by running the electrolysis with
average utilisation rates between 36\% and 40\% (see
\cref{fig:output-ts-1,fig:output-ts-3}).  The produced hydrogen is buffered in
salt caverns which then allows again for a stable subsequent production of
synthetic hydrocarbons. For Fischer-Tropsch plants, for instance, we see much
higher average utilisation rates between 87\% and 95\% which aligns with such a
plant's beneficial operating conditions and is caused by the high upfront
investment costs we assume. Their operation is only interrupted in winter
periods with low wind speeds and low ambient temperatures to give way to backup
heat and power supply options (see \cref{fig:output-ts-1,fig:output-ts-3}). By
exploiting periods of peak generation and curbing production in periods of
scarcity, large amounts of variable renewable power generation that serves the
systems' abundant synthetic fuel demands can be incorporated into the system
cost-effectively. This ultimately leads to low levels of firm capacity. We
observe OCGT and CHP plant capacities between 123 and 216~GW\el compared to peak
electricity consumption of 2112~GW\el. The lowest values were attained when
additional power transmission could be built.

% most firm capacity is CHP, only up to 30 GW OCGT

Hydrogen storage is required to benefit from temporal balancing through flexible
electrolyser operation. We find cost-optimal storage capacities between
\SIrange{62}{66}{\twh} with a hydrogen network and \SIrange{32}{35}{\twh}
without a hydrogen network while featuring similar filling level patterns
throughout the year. Almost all hydrogen is stored in salt caverns, exploiting
vast geological potentials across Europe mostly in Northern Ireland, England and
Denmark. We observe no storage in steel tanks unless neither a hydrogen nor the
electricity network can be expanded. In this case, we see up to 1.3~TWh of steel
tank capacity, which represents only 4\% of the respective total hydrogen
storage capacity. If the hydrogen network development is restricted, less
hydrogen storage is built since options for cheap underground storage are
limited to regions with salt deposits and become less accessible.

Together with the supporting infrastructure, the production of huge amounts of
hydrogen (2437~TWh/a) offers versatile use cases. Most of the hydrogen is used
to produce Fischer-Tropsch fuels for organic chemicals and transport fuels
(1425~TWh/a), of which 356 TWh/a is useable as a by-product in the form of waste
heat for district heating networks. A total of 778~TWh/a is used in shipping
(two thirds) and land transport (one third). The industry sector consumes
196~TWh/a, excluding use of hydrogen for industry feedstock (e.g.~high-value
chemicals). Around 79~TWh/a of hydrogen is lost during synthetic fuel
production. If the electricity grid expansion is restricted, but hydrogen can be
transported, even more hydrogen is produced to be re-electrified in fuel cells
during critical phases of system operation (100 TWh\el~or 200 TWh$_{\ce{H2}}$).
According to \cref{fig:tsc}, these fuel cells would mostly be built inland in
Germany. Only 30~TWh/a is used to produce methane, which is needed for process
heat in some industrial applications and as a heating backup for power-to-heat
units. This is because the model prefers to use the full potential for biogas
(346~TWh/a) and limited amounts of fossil gas (371~TWh/a), which are offset by
sequestering biogenic carbon dioxide, over synthetic production.

Only in scenarios where hydrogen network expansion was restricted, we observe
notable synthetic methane production (\ce{H2}-to-\ce{CH4},
\SIrange{329}{563}{\twh}) and steam methane reforming with carbon capture
(\ce{CH4}-to-\ce{H2}, \SIrange{94}{216}{\twh}). In these cases, the route via
methane, which can still be transported freely through the gas network across Europe,
is partially used to counteract hydrogen transmission constraints. Direct air
capture (\SI{27}{\mega\tco\per\year}) was made use of only when both hydrogen and electricity
network expansion were forbidden and levels of methanation were highest. In all
other cases, sufficient carbon was available to the system from biogenic or
fossil sources, while still being able to stay within set sequestration limits.

        capacity (TW) or energy (EWh) by the length (km) of the network connection.}
    \label{fig:network-stats}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:network-stats} shows statistics on the total electricity and hydrogen
transmission capacity built as well as how much energy is moved through the
respective networks, while distinguishing between retrofitted and new
capacities.

Depending on the level of power grid expansion, between 342 and 422~TWkm of
hydrogen pipelines are built. The higher value is obtained when the hydrogen
network partially offsets the lack of electricity grid reinforcement. On the
other hand, restricting hydrogen expansion only has a small effect on
cost-optimal levels of power grid expansion. The length-weighted power grid
capacity is a little more than doubled in the least-cost scenario; without a
hydrogen network, the cost-optimal power grid capacity is 10\%
higher.

When both hydrogen and electricity grid expansion is allowed, both networks
transport approximately the same amount of energy
(\cref{fig:network-stats:ewhkm}). This is striking because the hydrogen network
capacity is less than half that of the power grid and more comparable with
today's power grid capacities (\cref{fig:network-stats:twkm}). In consequence,
the utilisation rate of 59\% of the hydrogen network is much higher than the
35\% of the electricity grid (\cref{fig:si:grid-utilisation}). One plausible
explanation for this observation is that the buffering of produced hydrogen in
stores allows more coordinated bulk energy tranport in hydrogen networks,
whereas the power grid directly balances the variability of renewable
electricity supply.

When electricity grid expansion is restricted, the hydrogen network plays a
dominant role in transporting energy around Europe. In this case, around three
times more energy is moved in the hydrogen network (2.8~EWhkm) than in the
electricity network (1~EWhkm). However, expansion restrictions in the
electricity network rather affect the division between hydrogen and electricity
flows than the total volume of energy transported. The total energy moved as
hydrogen or electricity is only reduced by 22\% by imposing restrictions on both
hydrogen and electricity transmission.

\section*{New hydrogen backbone can leverage repurposed natural gas pipelines}
\label{sec:repurposed}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\nameref{sec:repurposed}}

With our assumptions, developing electricity transmission lines is approximately
60\% more expensive than building new hydrogen pipelines. We assume costs for a
new hydrogen pipeline of 250~\euro/MW/km, whereas, for a new
high-voltage transmission line, we assume 400~\euro/MW/km (see~\cref{sec:si:costs}). Despite
higher costs, we observe that grid reinforcements are preferred over hydrogen
pipelines. Part of the reason may be that electricity is more versatile in our
scenarios with high levels of direct electrification. If hydrogen has to be
produced and then re-electrified, the efficiency losses mean additional generation
capacity would be needed to compensate. However, pipelines are particularly
attractive where the end-use is hydrogen-based.

The appeal of a hydrogen network is further spurred by existing natural gas
infrastructure available to be retrofitted. Repurposing a natural gas pipeline
to transport hydrogen instead cost just around half that of building a new
hydrogen pipeline (117 versus 250 \euro/MW/km; see~\cref{sec:si:costs}). For the
capacity retrofit we include costs for required compressor substitutions and
assume that for every unit of gas pipeline decommissioned, 60\% of its capacity
becomes available for hydrogen transport. In consequence, even detours of the
hydrogen network topology may be cost-effective if, through rerouting, more
repurposing potentials can be tapped.

As \cref{fig:h2-network} illustrates, the optimised hydrogen network topology is
highly concentrated in the North West of Europe. Individual pipeline connections
between regions have optimised capacities up to 50 GW. Of the total hydrogen
network volume, between 58\% and 66\% consists of repurposed gas pipelines. The
share is highest when the electricity grid is not permitted to be reinforced. Up
to a third of the existing natural gas network is retrofitted to transport hydrogen
instead, leaving large capacities that are used neither for hydrogen nor methane
transport, particularly in Germany, Poland, Italy and the North Sea. In our
scenarios, a little more than 40\% of retrofittable gas pipelines fully exhaust
their conversion potential to hydrogen. The most notable corridors for gas
pipeline retrofitting are located offshore across the North Sea and the English
Channel and in England, Germany, Austria, and Northern Italy. The sizeable
existing natural gas transmission capacities in Southern Italy and Eastern Europe are
not repurposed for hydrogen transport in this self-sufficient scenario for
Europe. However, this picture might change if clean energy import options were
considered. Since most hydrogen is used to produce synthetic fuels and ammonia,
if these were imported, much of the hydrogen demand would fall away, thereby
also reducing the need for hydrogen transport infrastructure. Moreover, direct
hydrogen imports into Europe may alter cost-effective network topologies as new
import locations need to be connected rather than domestic production. For
instance, the networks role might change from distributing energy from North Sea
hydrogen hubs to integrating inbound pipelines from North-Africa with increased
network capacities in Southern Europe.

% The most prominent new hydrogen pipelines are
% built in the British Isles, between Denmark and Germany, inside Belgium,
% Northern France and the Netherlands, and in the North-East of Spain.

\cref{fig:io} shows the net energy surpluses and deficits of each region
alongside so-called Lorenz curves that depict regional inequities between supply
and demand for each carrier and how they vary among the four network expansion
scenarios.

In line with previously shown capacity expansion plans, energy surplus is found
largely in the wind-rich coastal and solar-rich Southern regions that supply the
inland regions of Europe, which have high demands but less attractive renewable
potentials. The net energy surplus of individual regions amounts to up to 200
TWh. Examples are Danish offshore wind power exports and large wind-based
production sites for synthetic fuels in Ireland. For Ireland, this surplus is
roughly three times as high as its final energy demand, resulting in the
situation that three quarters of its energy production is exported. Net deficits
of single regions have similarly high values, close to 200 TWh. Examples are, in
particular, the metropolitan areas around London and Paris, as well as the
industrial cluster between Rotterdam and the Ruhr valley.

Energy transport infrastructure fuels the uneven regional distribution of supply
relative to demand. This is illustrated by the Lorenz curves presented in
\cref{fig:io} for different energy carriers and network expansion scenarios. The
Lorenz curves plot the carrier's cumulative share of supply versus the
cumulative share of demand, sorted by the ratio of supply and demand in
ascending order. If the annual sums of supply and demand are equal in each
region, the Lorenz curve resides on the identity line. However, the more unequal
the regional supply is relative to demand, the further the curve dents into the

For the least-cost scenario, \cref{fig:io:w-el-w-h2} highlights that hydrogen
supply is more regionally imbalanced relative to demand than electricity supply.
Roughly 60\% of the hydrogen demand is consumed in regions that produce less
than 1\% of the total hydrogen supply. Conversely, 40\% of the hydrogen supply
is produced in regions that consume less than 5\% of total hydrogen demand.
Naturally, reduced electricity grid expansion causes more evenly distributed
electricity supply (\cref{fig:io:wo-el-w-h2,fig:io:wo-el-wo-h2}). If hydrogen
transport is restricted (\cref{fig:io:w-el-wo-h2,fig:io:wo-el-wo-h2}), the
production of liquid hydrocarbons is increased in renewable-rich regions because
they can be transported at low cost. In this case, 70\% of the demand for
oil-based products is consumed in regions that produce less than 1\% of the
total supply. With full network expansion, 70\% of demand is consumed in regions
that produce 16\% of the total supply.

% - 17\% of oil from fossil sources
% - 45\% of methane comes from unlocated fossil sources (explains steep end)
