\section*{Energy and carbon balances are dominated by wind and solar supply, electricity and heat demand, emissions of hydrocarbons, and removal from biomass}
\label{sec:balances}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\nameref{sec:balances}}

First of all, we underline with the energy balance in \cref{fig:balance} the
central role of wind and solar electricity supply in all scenarios.
Hydroelectricity, biomass and the recovery of ambient heat through heat pumps
further support the energy supply, whereas fossil oil and gas only play a
marginal role as options to offset their emissions are limited by the assumed
sequestration potentials. Electricity demand for industrial processes,
electrified transport and the residential sector, alongside heat for hot water
provision, space heating and industrial processes, dominate the energy
consumption. For the most part, hydrogen is only an intermediate product between
electricity and another energy carrier. There are only few direct applications
of hydrogen, for instance, in the industry sector for producing steel with
hydrogen-based direct reduced iron rather than coke-fired integrated steelworks,
as well as for heavy-duty land transport. Most hydrogen is used to produce
derivatives like Fischer-Tropsch fuels, methane and methanol, which are used for
dense aviation and shipping fuels and as feedstock for high-value chemicals.
These liquid hydrocarbons are the third largest consumer in the energy balance.
In terms of energy, the reconversion of hydrogen to electricity only assumes a
secondary role. Conversion losses are also shown and are most pronounced for
electrolysis, as we assume that waste heat from other fuel synthesis plants can
be injected into the local district heating networks.

The atmospheric \co balance in \cref{fig:balance} shows that liquid hydrocarbons
in shipping, aviation and the decay or incineration of plastics constitute the
major uncaptured carbon dioxide emissions in the system. Some additional \co is
emitted through using methane (natural gas, biogas or synthetic) in gas boilers
and CHP plants in the heating sector during the challenging cold winter periods
with low renewable energy supply. Industrial process emissions are largely
captured such that, owing to imperfect capture rates, only residual emissions
are released into the atmosphere. Most carbon dioxide removal is achieved
through biomass technologies. For instance, biogenic \co is captured in biomass
CHP plants or industrial low-temperature heat applications. Direct air capture
takes a much smaller supplementary part. Of the \co handled by the system for
the synthesis of electrofuels and long-term sequestration, the largest share is
of biogenic origin (62\%) followed by fossil \co (25\%); direct air capture has
the smallest share with (13\%). The broad availability of captured \co from
industrial processes and biofuel combustion is advantageous for the system, as
it lowers the cost of fuel synthesis by evading costly and energy-intensive
direct air capture.

\section*{Cost benefit of hydrogen network is consistent, and strongest without power grid expansion}
\label{sec:h2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\nameref{sec:h2}}

In \cref{fig:sensitivity-h2}, we first compare the total energy system costs and
their composition between the four main scenarios, which vary in whether or not
the power grid can be expanded beyond today's levels and if a new hydrogen
network based on new and retrofitted pipelines can be built. Across all
scenarios, the total costs are dominated by investments in wind and solar
capacities, power-to-heat applications (primarily heat pumps), and in
electrolysers and further electrofuel synthesis plants (for transport fuels and
as a feedstock for the chemicals industry). System costs vary between
\minsystemcost~and \maxsystemcost~bn\euro/a, depending on available network
expansion options.

Overall, we find that energy system costs are not overly affected by restrictions on
the development of electricity or hydrogen transmission infrastructure. The
realisable cost savings are small compared to total costs, and systems
without grid expansion appear as equally feasible alternatives. The
combined net benefit of hydrogen and electricity grid expansion is
\gridbenefitabs~bn\euro/a; a system without either would be around
\gridbenefitrel\% more expensive. This limited cost increase can be attributed
to the high level of synthetic fuel production for industry, transport, and
backup electricity and heating applications. The option for a flexible operation
of conversion plants, inexpensive energy storage and low-cost energy transport as
hydrocarbons between regions offer sufficient leeway to manage electricity and
hydrogen transport restrictions effectively (see \nameref{sec:es}).

The total net benefit of power grid expansion is between
\minacbenefitabs-\maxacbenefitabs~bn\euro/a
(\minacbenefitrel-\maxacbenefitrel\%) compared to costs for transmission
reinforcements between \minaccost-\maxaccost~bn\euro/a. System costs decrease
despite the increasing investments in electricity transmission infrastructure.
The benefit is strongest if no hydrogen network can compensate for the lack of
electricity grid capacity to transport energy over long distances.
\cref{sec:si:lv} presents additional intermediate system cost changes between a
doubling of power grid capacity and no grid expansion. Electricity grid
reinforcement enables renewable resources with higher capacity factors to be
integrated from further away, resulting in lower capacity needs for solar and
wind. The grid also allows renewable variations to be smoothed in space and
facilitates the integration of offshore wind, resulting in lower hydrogen demand
for balancing power and heat and less hydrogen infrastructure (electrolysis,
cavern storage, re-conversion, pipelines). Restrictions on power grid expansion
entail more local production from solar photovoltaics and increased hydrogen
production.

The presence of a new hydrogen network can reduce system costs by up to
\maxhybenefitrel\%. The net benefit between
\minhybenefitabs-\maxhybenefitabs~bn\euro/a
(\minhybenefitrel-\maxhybenefitrel\%) largely exceeds the cost of the hydrogen
network, which costs between \minhycost-\maxhycost~bn\euro/a. Its system cost
benefit is strongest when the electricity grid is not expanded. However, even
with high levels of power grid expansion, the hydrogen network is still
beneficial infrastructure. The hydrogen network offers an alternative for bulk
energy transport from the windiest and sunniest regions in Europe's periphery to
low-cost geological storage sites and the industrial clusters in Central Europe
with high energy demand but less attractive and more constrained renewable
potentials (see \nameref{sec:energy-moved}).

Although power grid reinforcements provide higher cost reductions, hydrogen and
electricity networks are strongest together. Around
\hyoftotalbenefit\% of the combined cost benefit of transmission infrastructure
can be achieved solely with a new hydrogen network. In contrast,
\acoftotalbenefit\% of the combined cost benefit can be reached by just
reinforcing the electricity transmission system. Compared to the combined net
benefit of \gridbenefitabs~bn\euro/a, the individual benefits sum up to a value
that is only \additivebenefitrel\% higher (\maxacbenefitabs{} + \maxhybenefitabs{} =
\additivebenefitabs{} bn\euro/a). Thus, offered cost reductions are mainly
additive.

This also means that a hydrogen network cannot substitute perfectly for power
grid reinforcements. It can only partially compensate for the lack of grid
expansion, yielding only \benefithyofac\% of the cost reductions achieved
by electricity grid expansion. Instead, energy transport as electrons and
molecules seem to offer complementary strengths. From a system-level
perspective, network expansion will only lead to small cost reductions.
A system built exclusively around hydrogen network expansion is just \acvshycost\%
more expensive than an alternative system that only allows electricity grid
expansion.

\section*{Common design features across four scenarios of European climate neutrality}
\label{sec:es}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\nameref{sec:es}}

Across all scenarios, we see \SIrange{\minoffwind}{\maxoffwind}{\giga\watt}
offshore wind, \SIrange{\minonwind}{\maxonwind}{\giga\watt} onshore wind, and
\SIrange{\minsolar}{\maxsolar}{\giga\watt} solar photovoltaics
(\cref{fig:si:capacities}). The wide range of solar capacities is due to an
increased localisation of electricity generation through solar photovoltaics
when the expansion of transmission infrastructure is limited. As network
expansion options are constrained, we see demand for local daily storage with
batteries almost quadrupling (from 73 to 272 GW with an energy-to-power ratio of
6 hours) and doubling for synoptic and seasonal storage with hydrogen and
thermal storage (from 73 to 141 TWh, see \cref{fig:si:capacities}). For all
scenarios, the capacities of photovoltaics split on average into
\meanrooftopshare\% rooftop PV and \meanutilityshare\% utility-scale PV. The
offshore share of wind generation capacities varies between \minoffshoreshare\%
and \maxoffshoreshare\% and is highest when networks can be fully expanded.

The spatial distribution of investments per scenario is shown in \cref{fig:tsc}.
While solar capacities are found throughout Europe, especially in the South,
onshore and offshore wind capacities are mostly found in the North Sea region
and the British Isles. When allowed, new electricity transmission capacity is
built where they help the integration of remote wind production and the
transport to inland demand centres (see \nameref{sec:h2}). Consequently, most
grid expansion is seen in and between Northwestern and Central Europe. Battery
storage pairs with solar generation in Southern Euope, particularly when power
grid reinforcement is limited. Besides their wider use overall, battery
deployment also progresses northbound in this case.

Furthermore, electrolyser capacities for power-to-hydrogen see a massive
scale-up to between \SIrange{\minelectrolysis}{\maxelectrolysis}{\giga\watt}
depending on the scenario. The capacities are lowest when the electricity grid
can be expanded. In this case, their locations correlate strongly with wind and
solar capacities (Pearson correlation coefficient $R^2=0.64$ for each,
\cref{fig:tsc}). If no hydrogen or electricity transmission expansion is
allowed, the electrolysis correlates more strongly with wind ($R^2=0.74$) than
solar ($R^2=0.46$). The build-out of hydrogen production facilities is
accompanied by a network of pipelines and hydrogen underground storage in Europe
to help balance generation from renewables in time and space.

In space, a new pipeline network transports hydrogen from preferred production
sites to the rest of Europe, where hydrogen is consumed by industry (for
ammonia, high-value chemicals and steel production), aviation and shipping, as
well as fuel cell CHPs for combined power and heat backup. Varying in magnitude
per scenario, we see major net flows of hydrogen from Great Britain to the
Benelux Union, Germany and Norway, from Northern Germany to the South, and from
the East of Spain to Southern France. The favoured network topology strongly
depends on the potentials for cheap renewable electricity. If onshore wind
potentials were restricted, e.g. due to limited social acceptance in Northern
Europe, the network infrastructure would be tailored to deliver larger amounts
of solar-based hydrogen from Southern Europe to Central Europe. We discuss this
supplementary sensitivity analysis in \cref{sec:si:onw,sec:si:onw-compromise}.

% Compared to net flows in the electricity network,
% which also balances renewable generation back and forth as weather systems pass
% the continent, the hydrogen network more distinctly targets energy transport
% over long distances (see also \nameref{sec:imbalance} and
% \cref{fig:si:flow-ac,fig:h2-network}).

The development of a hydrogen network is driven by the fact that (i) industry
demand for hydrogen is located in areas with less attractive renewable
potentials, (ii) the best wind and solar potentials are located in the periphery
of Europe, (iii) bottlenecks in the electricity transmission network give
impetus to alternative energy transport options, and (iv) moving hydrogen from
production sites to where the geological conditions allow for cheap underground
storage is significantly more cost-effective than local storage in steel tanks.
Another subsidiary location factor for hydrogen network infrastructure is linked
to the siting of electrofuel production. Because we assume that waste heat from
these processes can be recovered for district heating networks, urban areas with
attractive renewable potentials nearby may be preferred sites for fuel synthesis
to which the hydrogen would need to be transferred. Since we assume that liquid
hydrocarbons can be moved freely in the model, the spatial distribution of their
demands is not a siting factor that is considered. Neither is the location of
carbon dioxide sources and sinks.

The flexible operation of electrolysers further supports the system integration
of variable renewables in time. Hydrogen production leverages periods with
exceptionally high wind speeds across Europe by running the electrolysis with
average utilisation rates between \mincfelectrolysis\% and \maxcfelectrolysis\%
(see \cref{fig:output-ts-1,fig:output-ts-3}). The produced hydrogen is buffered
in salt caverns which then allows for higher full load hours of fuel synthesis
processes. For Fischer-Tropsch and methanolisation plants, we see average
utilisation rates between \mincfFT\% and \maxcfFT\% which aligns with the higher
upfront investment costs of these processes. Their operation is mostly
interrupted in winter periods with low wind speeds and low ambient temperatures
to give way to backup heat and power supply options (see
\cref{fig:output-ts-1,fig:output-ts-3}). By exploiting periods of peak
generation and curbing production in periods of scarcity, large amounts of
variable renewable power generation that serves the systems' abundant synthetic
fuel demands can be incorporated into the system cost-effectively. This
ultimately leads to little curtailment of renewables between 2\% and 3\%
(\cref{fig:si:curtailment}) and low levels of firm capacity. In relation to a
peak electricity consumption of 2626~GW\el, we observe OCGT and CHP plant
capacities between 106 and 218~GW\el, most of which are gas CHP plants. The
lowest values were attained when additional power transmission could be built.

Hydrogen storage is required to benefit from temporal balancing through flexible
electrolyser operation. We find cost-optimal storage capacities between
\SIrange{\hydrogenstorageacyhyy}{\hydrogenstorageacnhyy}{\twh} with a hydrogen
network and \SIrange{\hydrogenstorageacnhyn}{\hydrogenstorageacyhyn}{\twh}
without a hydrogen network while featuring similar filling level patterns
throughout the year (\cref{fig:si:soc}). Almost all hydrogen is stored in salt
caverns, exploiting vast geological potentials across Europe mostly in Northern
Ireland, England and Denmark. We observe no storage in steel tanks unless
neither a hydrogen nor the electricity network can be expanded. In this case, we
see up to 1~TWh of steel tank capacity, which represents 5\% of the total
hydrogen storage capacity. If the options for network development are
restricted, more hydrogen storage is built to balance renewables in time rather
than space.

Together with the supporting infrastructure, the production of large amounts of
hydrogen (\hydrogenproduction~TWh/a) offers versatile use cases. Most of the
hydrogen is used to produce methanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels for organic
chemicals and transport fuels in aviation and shipping
(\ptlhydrogenusage~TWh/a), of which \ptlwasteheat~TWh/a is useable  in the form
of waste heat for district heating networks. A total of
\hydrogentransportdemand~TWh/a is used in land transport, while the industry
sector consumes \hydrogenindustrydemand~TWh/a, excluding the consumption of hydrogen for
industry feedstocks (e.g.~high-value chemicals). Around \hydrogenlosses~TWh/a of
hydrogen is lost during synthetic fuel production. If the electricity grid
expansion is restricted, but hydrogen can be transported, even more hydrogen is
produced to be re-electrified in fuel cells during critical phases of system
operation (\hydrogenfuelcell~TWh$_{\ce{H2}}$). According to \cref{fig:tsc},
these fuel cells would mostly be built inland in Central Europe. In all scenarios with
network expansion, no synthetic methane for process
heat in some industrial applications and as a heating backup for power-to-heat
units is produced. This is because the model prefers to use the full potential
for biogas (\biogas~TWh/a) and limited amounts of fossil gas (\fossilgas~TWh/a),
which are offset by sequestering biogenic carbon dioxide, over synthetic
production.

Only when neither hydrogen nor power network expansion were allowed, we see
methanation (\ce{H2}-to-\ce{CH4}, \SI{\hydrogenmethanation}{\twh}) and steam
methane reforming with carbon capture (\ce{CH4}-to-\ce{H2},
\SI{\bluehydrogen}{\twh}). In this case, despite the associated conversion
losses, synthetic methane is used as a transport medium to use the existing gas
network to counteract the restricted transport options otherwise. Apart from
imperfect capture rates of 90\% that requires supplementing some CO$_2$, this
process creates a carbon cycle provided that the \co is returned to the
methanation sites with an appropriate \co transport infrastructure. Direct air
capture (\SIrange{\mindac}{\maxdac}{\mega\tco\per\year}) was made use of in all
scenarios, supplementing carbon available from biogenic or fossil sources, while
remaining within set sequestration limits. For a comprehensive overview of
energy and carbon flows in each scenario see
\cref{fig:si:sankey,fig:si:carbon-sankey}.

%  shows statistics on the total electricity and hydrogen
% transmission capacity built as well as how much energy is moved through the
% respective networks, while distinguishing between retrofitted and new
% capacities.

Depending on the level of power grid expansion, between 204 and
307~TWkm of hydrogen pipelines are built
(\cref{fig:network-stats:twkm}). The higher value is obtained when the hydrogen
network partially offsets the lack of electricity grid reinforcement. On the
other hand, restricting hydrogen expansion only has a small effect on
cost-optimal levels of power grid expansion. The length-weighted power grid
capacity is more than doubled in the least-cost scenario; without a hydrogen
network, the cost-optimal power grid capacity is \twkmhigher\% higher.

When both hydrogen and electricity grid expansion is allowed, the hydrogen
network transports approximately half the amount of energy transmitted via the
electricity network (\cref{fig:network-stats:ewhkm}). This is striking because
the hydrogen network capacity is little more than a quarter that of the power
grid (\cref{fig:network-stats:twkm}). In consequence, the utilisation rate of
\utilisationHy\% of the hydrogen network is much higher than the
\utilisationAC\% of the electricity grid (\cref{fig:si:grid-utilisation}). One
plausible explanation for this observation is that the buffering of produced
hydrogen in cavern storage allows more coordinated bulk energy tranport in
hydrogen networks, whereas the power grid directly balances the variability of
renewable electricity supply and is subject to linearised power flow physics
(Kirchhoff's circuit laws).

When electricity grid expansion is restricted, the hydrogen network plays a
dominant role in transporting energy around Europe. In this case, around twice
as much energy is moved in the hydrogen network (\ewhkmhydrogen~EWhkm) than in
the electricity network (\ewhkmelectricity~EWhkm). Between only power grid
expansion and only hydrogen network expansion, the difference in the total
volume of energy transported is only \ewhkmdiff\%.

\end{figure}

With our assumptions, developing electricity transmission lines is approximately
60\% more expensive than building new hydrogen pipelines. We assume costs for a
new hydrogen pipeline of 250~\euro/MW/km, whereas, for a new high-voltage
transmission line, we assume 400~\euro/MW/km (see~\cref{sec:si:costs}). Despite
higher costs, we observe that electricity grid reinforcements are preferred over
hydrogen pipelines. Part of the reason may be that electricity is more versatile
in our scenarios with high levels of direct electrification. If hydrogen has to
be produced and then re-electrified, the efficiency losses mean additional
generation capacity would be needed to compensate. This makes energy transport
in form of hydrogen less competitive. However, hydrogen pipelines are
particularly attractive where the end-use is hydrogen-based.

The appeal of a hydrogen network is further spurred when existing natural gas
pipelines are available for retrofitting. Repurposing costs just around half
that of building a new hydrogen pipeline (117 versus 250 \euro/MW/km;
see~\cref{sec:si:costs}). For the capacity retrofit we include costs for
required compressor substitutions and assume that for every unit of gas pipeline
decommissioned, 60\% of its capacity becomes available for hydrogen transport.
In consequence, even detours of the hydrogen network topology may be
cost-effective if, through rerouting, more repurposing potentials can be tapped.

As \cref{fig:h2-network} illustrates, the optimised hydrogen network topology is
built around supporting flows into the industry and population centres of
Central Europe. We see strong pipeline connections in Northwestern Europe to
integrate wind-based hydrogen hubs as well as connections for the transport of
solar hydrogen hubs from Spai, Italy and Greece. Individual pipeline connections
between regions have optimised capacities up to 30 GW. Of the total hydrogen
network volume, between \minretroshare\% and \maxretroshare\% consists of
repurposed gas pipelines. The share is highest when the electricity grid is not
permitted to be reinforced. Up to a quarter of the existing natural gas network
is retrofitted to transport hydrogen instead, leaving large capacities that are
used neither for hydrogen nor methane transport. In our scenarios, 29-42\% of
retrofittable gas pipelines fully exhaust their conversion potential to
hydrogen. The most notable corridors for gas pipeline retrofitting are located
offshore across the North Sea and the English Channel and in Great Britain,
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Northern France and Italy. The most prominent new
hydrogen pipelines are built in the British Isles particularly to connect
Ireland, Northern France, the Netherlands, and in Spain and Portugal. The
sizeable existing natural gas transmission capacities in Southern Italy and
Eastern Europe are largely not repurposed for hydrogen transport in this
self-sufficient scenario for Europe.

However, this picture would change if clean energy import options were
considered. Since most hydrogen is used to produce synthetic fuels and ammonia,
if these were imported, much of the hydrogen demand would fall away, thereby
also reducing the extent hydrogen infrastructure. We present this case in
\cref{sec:si:sensitivity-imports}. Moreover, direct hydrogen imports into Europe
could alter cost-effective network topologies as new import locations need to be
connected rather than domestic production sites. For instance, the networks role
might change from distributing energy from North Sea hydrogen hubs to
integrating inbound pipelines from North-Africa with increased network
capacities in Southern Europe.\cite{wetzelGreenEnergy2022}

In line with previously shown capacity expansion plans, energy surplus is found
largely in the windy coastal and sunny Southern regions that supply the inland
regions of Europe, which have high demands but less attractive renewable
potentials (\cref{fig:io}). The net energy surplus of individual regions amounts
to up to 260 TWh. Examples are Danish offshore wind power exports and large
wind-based production sites for synthetic fuels in Ireland. For Denmark, this
surplus is more than twice as high as its final energy demand, resulting in the
situation that three quarters of Denmark's energy production is exported. Net
deficits of single regions can have similarly high values, close to 200 TWh.
Examples are, in particular, the industrial cluster between Rotterdam and the
Ruhr valley as well as other European metropolises.

Energy transport infrastructure fuels the uneven regional distribution of supply
relative to demand. This is illustrated by the Lorenz curves in
\cref{fig:io} for different energy carriers. The
Lorenz curves plot the carrier's cumulative share of supply versus the
cumulative share of demand, sorted by the ratio of supply and demand in
ascending order. If the annual sums of supply and demand are equal in each
region, the Lorenz curve resides on the identity line. However, the more unequal
the regional supply is relative to demand, the further the curves dent into the
graph's bottom right corner.

For the least-cost scenario, \cref{fig:io:w-el-w-h2} highlights that hydrogen
supply is slightly more regionally imbalanced relative to demand than
electricity supply. Roughly 60\% of the hydrogen demand is consumed in regions
that produce less than 11\% of the total hydrogen supply. Conversely, 40\% of
the hydrogen supply is produced in regions that consume less than 12\% of total
hydrogen demand. Naturally, reduced electricity grid expansion causes more
evenly distributed electricity supply
(\cref{fig:io:wo-el-w-h2,fig:io:wo-el-wo-h2}). If hydrogen transport is
restricted (\cref{fig:io:w-el-wo-h2,fig:io:wo-el-wo-h2}), the production of
liquid hydrocarbons is increased in regions with attractive renewable potentials
because they can be transported at low cost.

%In this case, 70\% of the demand for
% liquid hydrocarbons is consumed in regions that produce less than 1\% of the
% total supply. With full network expansion, 70\% of demand is consumed in regions
% that produce 16\% of the total supply.
