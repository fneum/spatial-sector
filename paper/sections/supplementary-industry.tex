Industry demand is split into a dozen different sectors, with the major ones
being iron and steel, cement and basic chemicals. The location of existing
industrial facilities is based on the Hotmaps.... \citeS{}. Demand for materials
can either be met using existing conventional routes, such as blast furnaces for
iron and rotary kilns for cement, or with new processes, such as hydrogen direct
reduction for iron or kilns equipped with CCS. Basic chemicals can use green
hydrogen as a feedstock rather than fossil fuels, for example for ammonia
production, or using Fischer-Tropsch naphtha in steam crackers for the production of High Value
Chemicals (HVCs).

Fossil fuels are used for process heat in the chemicals industry, but also as a feedstock for chemicals like
ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4) and methanol (CH3OH)

emissions
- energy-related
- process-related

For process-related emissions need alternative manufacturing process
or higher rates of recycling such that less virgin material is needed

largest sectors (according to FEC)
- iron and steel
- chemicals
- non-metallic mineral products
- pulp paper printing
- food beverages tobacco
- non-ferrous metals

Demand

For the industry energy demand, we assume the same
production of materials as today, but with process switching, fuel switching to
low-emission alternatives as well as carbon capture for use or sequestration
(CCU/S).

Process switching includes, for example, moving primary production of
steel from blast furnace reduction to direct reduction with hydrogen, or
switching to an oxyfuel process in cement manufacture.

Fuel switching means
replacing mechanical processes and process heat applications that use fossil
fuels with low-emission alternatives such as electricity, biomass or synthetic
fuels such as hydrogen or methane.

Feedstocks for the chemicals industry are
also converted to non-fossil alternatives.

To determine where fuel switching can take place we use the breakdown of energy
usage for each process within each sector provided by the JRC-IDEES database
\citeS{IDEES}.

Where there are fossil and electrified alternatives for the same
process (e.g. in glass manufacture or drying in industry XX) we assume that the
process is completely electrified.

Where process heat is required (steam
process?) our approach depends on the temperature required
\citeS{naeglerQuantificationEuropean2015,rehfeldtBottomupEstimation2018}. Processes that require temperatures below
\SI{500}{\celsius} are supplied with solid biomass, since we assume that residues and
wastes are not suitable for high-temperature applications. We see solid biomass
use primarily in the pulp and paper industry, where it is already widespread,
and in food, beverages and tobacco, where it replaces natural gas. Industries
which require high temperatures (above \SI{500}{\celsius}), such as metals, chemicals
and non-metalic minerals are either electified where processes already exist, or
the heat is provided with synthetic methane.

what is currently supplied with electricity (lighting, air compressors, motor drives, fans, pumps)
and low-enthalpy heat demand are directly added to electricity and heat buses

Industry heat demand can be supplied via DH or is added to services heat demand.
Can be supplied by other processes producing heat as byproduct (DAC, FT)

For EU-28 plus NO, CH, IL Rehfeldt estimated that from 2015 industrial heat demand
45\% is above \SI{500}{\celsius}, 30\% \SIrange{100}{500}{\celsius}, 25\% below \SI{100}{\celsius}

\citeS{naeglerQuantificationEuropean2015} similarly:
48\% is above \SI{400}{\celsius}, 27\% \SIrange{100}{400}{\celsius}, 25\% below \SI{100}{\celsius}

Because of high share of high-temperature process heat demand
- no geothermal
- no solar thermal supply

process heat supplied by methane, biomass, electricity depending on sector

Based on materials demand from JRC-IDEES and other sources such as the USGS for
ammonia.

Industry is split into many sectors, including iron and steel, ammonia, other
basic chemicals, cement, non-metalic minerals, alumuninium, other non-ferrous
metals, pulp, paper and printing, food, beverages and tobacco, and other more
minor sectors.

Inside each country the industrial demand is distributed using the Hotmaps
Industrial Database.

Hotmaps open database includes cement, basic chemicals, glass, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals,
non-metallic minerals, paper, refineries. Enables regional analyses, calculation of
site-specific energy demand, waste heat potentials, emissions, market shares,
process-specific evaluations

calculate energy demands and process emissions per unit of material based on JRC-IDEES

material output per country from JRC IDEES, ammonia production statistics,
Eurostat energy balances, national statistics from Switzerland to calculate total energy demand
and process emissions by sector

material output assumed to stay constant (exception recycling)

Supply

Process switching (e.g. from blast furnaces to direct reduction and electric arc
furnaces for steel) is defined exogenously.

Fuel switching for process heat is mostly also done exogenously.

Solid biomass is used for up to 500 Celsius, mostly in paper and pulp and food
and beverages.

Higher temperatures are met with methane.

\citeS{neuwirthFuturePotential2022}

\subsection{Iron and Steel}
\label{sec:si:industry:steel}

\citeS{toktarovaInteractionElectrified2022, mandovaPossibilitiesCO22018, suopajarviUseBiomass2018,voglPhasingOut2021, bhaskarDecarbonizingPrimary}

Two alternative routes are used today to manufacture steel in Europe. The
primary route (integrated steelworks) represents 60\% of steel production, while
the secondary route (electric arc furnaces), represents the other 40\%
\citeS{lechtenbohmerDecarbonisingEnergy2016}.

The primary route uses blast furnaces in which coke is used to reduce iron ore
into molten iron.
\begin{align}
    \ce{CO2 + C &-> 2CO}, \\
    \ce{3Fe2O3 + CO &-> 2Fe3O4 + CO}, \\
    \ce{Fe3O4 + CO &-> 3FeO + CO2}, \\
    \ce{FeO + CO &-> Fe + CO2}.
\end{align}
% \begin{equation}
%     \ce{2Fe2O3 + 3C -> 4Fe + 3CO2}.
% \end{equation}
which is then converted to steel. The primary route of steelmaking implies large
process emissions of \SI{0.22}{\tco\per\tonne} of steel.

In the secondary route, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are used to melt scrap
metal. This limits the \co emissions to the burning of graphite electrodes
\citeS{Friedrichsen_2018}, and reduces process emissions to
\SI{0.03}{\tco\per\tonne} of steel.

Integrated steelworks can be replaced by direct reduced iron (DRI) and subsequent processing in an electric arc furnace (EAF)
\begin{align}
    \ce{3Fe2O3 + H2 &-> 2Fe3O4 + H2O}, \\
    \ce{Fe3O4 + H2 &-> 3FeO + H2O}, \\
    \ce{FeO + H2 &-> Fe + H2O}.
\end{align}
This circumvents the process emissions associated with the use of coke. For
hydrogen-based DRI we assume energy requirements of 1.7 MWh$_{H_2}$/t steel
\citeS{voglAssessmentHydrogen2018} and 0.322 MWh$_{el}$/t steel
\citeS{}.

The shares of steel produced via each of the three routes by 2050 is exogenously
set in the model. We assume that hydrogen-based DRI plus EAF replaces integrated
steelworks for primary production completely, representing 30\% of total steel
production (down from 60\%). The remaining 70\% (up from 40\%) are manufactured
through the secondary route using scrap metal in EAF. According to
\citeS{circular_economy}, circular economy practices even have the potential to
expand the share of the secondary route to 85\% by increasing the amount and
quality of scrap metal collected.

For the remaining subprocesses in this sector, the following transformations are
assumed. Methane is used as energy source for the smelting process. Activities
associated with furnaces, refining and rolling, product finishing are
electrified assuming the current efficiency values for these cases.

\subsection{Chemicals Industry}
\label{sec:si:industry:chemicals}

The chemicals industry includes a wide range of diverse industries ranging from
the production of basic organic compounds (olefins, alcohols, aromatics), basic
inorcanic compounds (ammonia, chlorine), polymers (plastics), end-user products
(cosmetics, pharmaceutics).

The chemicals industry consumes large amounts of fossil-fuel based feedstocks
\citeS{leviMappingGlobal2018}, which can also be produced from renewables as
outlined for hydrogen in \cref{sec:si:h2:supply}, for methane in
\cref{sec:si:methane:supply}, and for oil-based products in
\cref{sec:si:oil:supply}. The ratio between synthetic and fossil-based fuels
used in the industry is an endogenous result of the optimisation.

Ammonia, which is commonly used as a fertiliser, can be made from hydrogen and nitrogen using the Haber-Bosch process \citeS{leviMappingGlobal2018}.
\begin{equation}
    \ce{N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3}
\end{equation}
Ammonia production for every country is taken from statistics provided by the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) \citeS{}. The Haber-Bosch process is not
explicitly represented in the model, such that demand for ammonia enters the
model as a demand for hydrogen (6.5 MWh\ce{H2}/t\ce{NH3}) and electricity (1.17
MWh$_{el}$/t\ce{NH3}) \citeS{Wang2018Joule}. Today, natural gas dominates in
Europe as the source for the hydrogen used in the Haber-Bosch process, but the
model can choose among the various hydrogen supply options described in
\cref{sec:si:h2:supply}

The basic chemicals in the JRC-IDEES database comprise high-value chemicals (ethylene, propylene and BTX), chlorine, methanol and ammonia

% Ethylene, used for plastics, can be made by steam cracking from naphtha or ethane or via methanol-to-olefin processes

\citeS{lechtenbohmerDecarbonisingEnergy2016} has 14.8 MWh FT-naphtha per ton of HVC, and 2.7 MWh per
ton for processing; 3.1 t\co/tHVC are captured from flue gases.

transformation of energy-consuming processes:
- FEC in steam processing is converted to methane since requires temperature above \SI{500}{\celsius} \citeS{rehfeldtBottomupEstimation2018}
- remaining processes are electrified using the current efficiency  of microwave for high-enthalpy heat processing,
electric furnaces, electric process cooling and electric generic processes

The process emissions from feedstock in the chemical industry are as high as
\SI{0.369}{\tco\per\tonne} of ethylene equivalent. We consider process emissions
for all the material output, which is a conservative approach since it assumes
that all plastic-embedded \co will eventually be released into the atmosphere.
However, plastic dispolsal in landfilling will avoid, or at least delay,
associated \co emissions.

\subsection{Non-metallic Mineral Products}
\label{sec:si:industry:nmmp}

This subsector includes the manufacturing of cement, ceramics, and glass.

\subsubsection{Cement}

Cement is used in construction to make concrete. The production of cement
involves high energy consumption and large process emissions. The calcination of
limestone to chemically reactive calcium oxide, also known as lime, involves
process emissions of \SI{0.54}{\tco\per\tonne} cement.
\begin{equation}
    \ce{CaCO3 -> CaO + \co}
\end{equation}
Additionally, \co is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels to provide
process heat. Thereby, cement constitutes the biggest source of industry
process emissions in Europe.

Cement process emissions can be captured assuming a capture rate of 90\%
\citeS{}. Whether emissions are captured is decided by the model taking into
account the capital costs of carbon capture modules. The electricity and heat
demand of process emission carbon capture is currently ignored. For net-zero
emission scenarios, the remaining process emissions need to be compansated by
negative emissions.

With the exception of electricity demand and biomass demand for low-temperature
heat, the final energy consumption of this subsector is assumed to be supplied
by methane, which is capable of delivering the required high-temperature heat.
This implies a switch from burning solid fuels to burning gas which will require
adjustments of the kilns \citeS{akhtarCoalNatural2013}.

Other mitigation strategies to reduce energy consumption or process emissions
(using new raw materials, recovering unused cement from concrete at end of life,
oxyfuel cement production to facilitate carbon sequestration, electric kilns for
heat provision) are at a early development stage and have therefore not been
considered.

\citeS{fennellDecarbonizingCement2021, kuramochiComparativeAssessment2012, lechtenbohmerDecarbonisingEnergy2016}

% \citeS{lechtenbohmerDecarbonisingEnergy2016} has electrification of cement with 0.9~MWh\el/tClinker

\subsubsection{Ceramics}

The ceramics sector is assumed to be fully electrified based on the current
efficiency of already electrified processes which include microwave drying and
sintering of raw materials, electric kilns for primary production processes,
electric furnaces for the product finishing. In total, the final electricity
consumption is 0.44 MWh/t of ceramic. The manufacturing of ceramics includes
process emissions of \SI{0.03}{\tco\per\tonne} of ceramic.

\citeS{furszyferdelrioDecarbonizingCeramics2022a}

\subsubsection{Glass}

The production of glass is assumed to be fully electrified based on the current
efficiency of electric melting tanks and electric annealing which adds up to an
electricity demand of 2.07 MWh/t of glass
\citeS{lechtenbohmerDecarbonisingEnergy2016}. The manufacturing of glass incurs
process emissions of \SI{0.1}{\tco\per\tonne} of glass.

\citeS{furszyferdelrioDecarbonizingGlass2022}

\citeS{lechtenbohmerDecarbonisingEnergy2016} also has big efficiency improvement with 0.85~MWh\el/tGlass.

\subsection{Non-ferrous Metals}
\label{sec:si:industry:nfm}

The non-ferrous metal subsector includes the manufacturing of base metals
(aluminium, copper, lead, zink), precious metals (gold, silver), and technology
metals (molybdenum, cobalt, silicon).

The manufacturing of aluminium accounts for more than half of the final energy
consumption of this subsector \citeS{}. Two alternative processing routes are
used today to manufacture aluminium in Europe. The primary route represents 40\%
of the aluminium production, while the secondary route represents the remaining
60\%.

The primary route involves two energy-intensive processes: the production of
alumina from bauxite (aluminium ore) and the electrolysis to transform alumina
into aluminium via the  Hall-H\'{e}roult process
\begin{equation}
    \ce{2Al2O3 + 3C -> 4Al + 3\co}.
\end{equation}
The primary route requires high-enthalpy heat \todo{How much energy?} to produce
alumina which is supplied by methane and causes process emissions of
\SI{1.5}{\tco\per\tonne} aluminium. According to  \citeS{Friedrichsen_2018},
inert anodes might become commercially available by 2030 that would eliminate
the process emissions. However, they have not been considered in this study.

In the secondary route, scrap aluminium is remelted. The energy demand for this
process is only 10\% of the primary route and there are no associated process
emissions. Assuming all subprocesses are electrified, the secondary route
requires 1.7 MWh/t of aluminium. Following \citeS{Friedrichsen_2018}, we assume
a share of recycled aluminium of 80\% by 2050.

For the other non-ferrous metals, we assume the electrification of the entire
manufacturing process with an average electricity demand of 3.2 MWh/t lead
equivalent. \todo{check source and code}

\subsection{Other Industry Subsectors}
\label{sec:si:industry:other}

The remaining industry subsectors include
(a) pulp, paper, printing,
(b) food, beverages, tobacco ,
(c) textiles and leather,
(d) machinery equipment,
(e) transport equipment,
(f) wood and wood products,
(g) others.
Low- and mid-temperature process heat in these industries is assumed to be supplied by biomass,
while the remaining processes are electrified.
None of the subsectors involve process emissions.
