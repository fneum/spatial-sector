To put our results into a broader perspective, for the discussion we compare our
results to related literature and proposals presented in the gas industry's
European Hydrogen Backbone reports. This is followed by an appraisal of the
limitations of our study.

\subsection*{Comparison to Related Literature}

\topic{European Commission}

Compared to the net-zero scenarios from the European Commission released in 2018
\cite{in-depth_2018}, we see much larger renewable electricity generation,
reaching beyond 8781~TWh/a. This represents almost a tripling of today's
electricity generation (270\% compared to at most a 150\% increase by 2050 in
\cite{in-depth_2018}), with roughly one third going to regular electricity
demand, one third going to newly electrified sectors in heating, transport and
industry, and one third going to hydrogen production (dominated by
Fischer-Tropsch fuels). The major difference is caused by lower electrification
rates in other sectors in \cite{in-depth_2018}, the higher biomass potentials in
\cite{in-depth_2018}, and the fact that \cite{in-depth_2018} relies on imports
of fossil oil for non-energy uses such as plastics and does not count them
towards net emissions as assumed in this study.

\topic{Previous Brown Research}

In Brown et al.~\cite{brownSynergiesSector2018}, an optimal grid expansion
brought a benefit of \euro~64~billion per year compared to the case with no
transmission between European countries, which is higher than the
\euro~47~billion per year benefit found here. There are at least four causes for
this difference: the model here has higher resolution (181 versus 30 regions)
which allows better placement of wind at good sites; here we start from today's
grid; in Brown et al.~\cite{brownSynergiesSector2018} there was no hydrogen
pipeline network and no underground hydrogen storage; and finally we have higher
demand for hydrogen from industry and synthetic fuels, which provides a large
flexible load that helps to integrate wind and solar.

\topic{Caglayan FZJ}

Caglayan et al.~\cite{Caglayan2019} also consider European decarbonisation
scenarios with both electricity transmission and new hydrogen pipelines, but at
a lower spatial resolution (96 regions). A similar pattern of hydrogen pipeline
expansion towards the British Isles and North Sea is seen, but lower overall
hydrogen capacities (258~GW compared to more than 1000~GW in our scenarios)
because industry, shipping, aviation, agriculture and non-electrified heating
are not included. Caglayan et al.~\cite{Caglayan2019} also find cost-optimal
hydrogen underground storage of 130~TWh, whereas our scenarios show less cavern
storage between 32 and 66~TWh.

\topic{European Hydrogen Backbone}

Our results align well with the proposals for a European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB)
from the gas industry
\cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2020,gasforclimateExtendingEuropean2021,gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2021,gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2022}.
Whereas the reports are presented as visions rather than proposals based on
detailed network planning, here, we present supporting modelling results based on
temporally resolved spatial co-planning of energy infrastructures.

While we see cost-optimal hydrogen network investments between 5-8 bn\euro/a,
the EHB report from April 2021 \cite{gasforclimateExtendingEuropean2021} finds
similar costs between 4-10 bn\euro/a across 21
countries\footnote{To calculate the annuity of the overnight hydrogen
network costs listed in the EHB reports, a lifetime of 50 years and a discount
rate of 7\% are assumed like for our own modelling.}. The extension to 28
countries from April 2022 \cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2022} reports costs
between 7-14 bn\euro/a.
% The latest report only misses a few countries in the
% Balkan to match the geographic scope of PyPSA-Eur-Sec.

% In total, one EHB report \cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2021} assumes a hydrogen
% demand between 2100 and 2700 TWh for the year 2050, which is similar to the
% range between 2400 and 3100 TWh in our analysis. However, the uses and supply
% routes are slightly different. In our model, we assume higher hydrogen demands
% for for shipping and the production of Fischer-Tropsch fuels as aviation fuel
% and feedstock for the plastics industry. Unlike we do, this EHB report considers energy
% imports into Europe and foresees a larger demand for hydrogen re-electrification
% of 650 TWh$_{\text{H}_2}$ \cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2021}, which is lower than
% the 200 TWh$_{\text{H}_2}$ in our analysis.

\cref{tab:ehb} compares the hydrogen network volume of the EHB from April 2021
to our analysis \cite{gasforclimateExtendingEuropean2021}\footnote{The newer
report from April 2022 \cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogen2022} lacks sufficient
data to calculate length-weighted network capacities.}. The volume is measured
as the length-weighted sum of pipeline capacities (TWkm) and distinguishes
between repurposed and new pipeline capacities. Both analyses build a similarly
sized hydrogen network. With electricity grid expansion, our results show a
hydrogen network that is 11\% larger; without grid expansion this difference
rises to 37\%. Furthermore, the share of retrofitted gas pipelines in the
hydrogen backbone is comparable. The 69\% volume share of repurposed gas
pipelines \cite{gasforclimateExtendingEuropean2021} agrees with our findings
where between 58\% and 66\% of hydrogen pipelines are retrofitted gas pipelines.

\subsection*{Selected limitations of the study and scope for future investigations}

\topic{import options}

In the presented scenarios, Europe is largely energy self-sufficient. While
limited amounts of fossil gas and oil imports are allowed, no imports of
renewable electricity or chemical energy carriers from outside of Europe are
considered. However, with imports system needs for electricity and hydrogen
transmission infrastructure may change substantially, which should be evaluated
in future work
\cite{fasihiTechnoeconomicAssessment2019,heuserTechnoeconomicAnalysis2019,hamppImportOptions2021}.

\topic{uneven infastructure}

Additionally, the very uneven distribution of infrastructure in our results may
cause public opposition to an extent that may block a swift energy transition.
Hence, future investigations should weigh the cost surcharge of increased
regionally self-sufficient energy supply against the potential benefit of higher
social acceptance and increased resiliency.

\topic{near-optimal solutions}

Moreover, previous research has shown that there are many directions in the
feasible space where the system composition can be changed with only a small
change in system costs. This makes robust statements about infrastructure needs
hard and more vague. While we present selected design trade-offs regarding
transmission networks, a more comprehensive exploration of near-optimal
solutions in sector-coupled systems using techniques like
Modelling-to-Generate-Alternatives (MGA)
\cite{Neumann2019,lombardiPolicyDecision2020,pedersenModelingAll2020}, would
likely reveal a broader range of alternative system layouts.

\topic{other limitations}

Besides, there are many more limitations pertaining to the quality and
availability of open data on demands and infrastructure, uncertainty in future
technology assumptions, limited robustness to interannual weather variation,
neglect of demand sufficiency, and exogenous assumptions about fuel and process
switching in transport and industry.
