\subsection*{Comparison to Related Literature}

Compared to the net-zero scenarios from the European Commission released in 2018
\cite{in-depth_2018}, we see much larger renewable generation, reaching beyond
10000~TWh/a\todo{check total renewable generation}. This represents a tripling
of today's electricity generation (compared to at most a 145\% increase by 2050
in \cite{in-depth_2018}), with roughly one third going to regular electricity
demand, one third going to newly-electrified sectors in heating, transport and
industry, and one third going to hydrogen production (dominated by
Fischer-Tropsch fuels). The major difference is caused by lower electrification
rates in other sectors in \cite{in-depth_2018}, the higher biomass potentials in
\cite{in-depth_2018}, and the fact that \cite{in-depth_2018} relies on imports
of fossil oil for non-energy uses such as plastics and does not count them
towards net emissions like we do.

In \cite{brownSynergiesSector2018} an optimal grid expansion brought a benefit
of \euro~64~billion per year compared to the case with no transmission between
European countries, which is higher than the \euro~44~billion per year benefit
found here. There are at least four causes for this difference: the model here
has higher resolution (181 versus 30 nodes) which allows better placement of
wind at good sites; here we start from today's grid, which already has some
international transmission; in \cite{brownSynergiesSector2018} there was no
hydrogen pipeline network and no underground hydrogen storage (just steel
tanks); and finally we have higher demand for hydrogen from industry and
synthetic fuels, which provides a large flexible load that helps to integrate
wind and solar.

Caglayan and co-authors \cite{Caglayan2019} also consider European
decarbonisation scenarios with both electricity transmission and new hydrogen
pipelines, but at a lower spatial resolution (96 nodes). A similar pattern of
hydrogen pipeline expansion towards the British Isles and North Sea is seen, but
lower overall hydrogen capacities because industry, shipping, aviation and
non-electrified heating are not included.

- EHB: \euro 4-8 bn/a

EHB
- made for hydrogen production of 20.6 Mt (692 TWh), demand 1640 TWh compared to XX TWh in our scenarios
- considers imports
- 60\% repurposed pipelines
- levelised transport cost (0.11-0.21 \euro/kg/1000km or 3.3-6.3 \euro/MWh/1000km)

\subsection*{Public acceptance for hydrogen infrastructure}

One of the biggest changes seen is the built-out of hydrogen infastructure: huge new
electrolyzer capacities, underground storage in salt caverns as well
as a new hydrogen pipeline network. It is not fully clear that a new
hydrogen network will have any higher public acceptance than the power
grid. However, if existing natural gas pipelines can be reused for hydrogen,
or if at least the pipeline routes can be used, and are always discreetly buried underground, the disturbance to
the public is minimised.

\subsection*{Energy imports and European self-sufficiency}

limitation no imports

in these scenarios, Europe is largely self-sufficient (fossil gas imports allowed)

very uneven infrastructure distribution

with imports
- strong point sources
- higher role of hydrogen network

future: increase self-sufficiency constraints of individual regions
